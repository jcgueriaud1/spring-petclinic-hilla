This is a Hilla implementation of the Spring PetClinic sample project: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic

[Hilla](https://vaadin.com/hilla/) is a full-stack React framework for Spring. It includes:

- A large library of [UI components](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/ds/components)
- Reactive TypeScript frontend using [React](https://react.dev/)
- Type-safe server communication and TS type generation based on Java

## Running petclinic locally

Petclinic is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/). You can run it from Maven directly using the Spring Boot Maven plugin. If you do this it will pick up changes that you make in the project immediately (changes to Java source files require a compile as well - most people use an IDE for this):

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You can then access petclinic here: http://localhost:8080/

> NOTE: Windows users should set `git config core.autocrlf true` to avoid format assertions failing the build (use `--global` to set that flag globally).

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (H2) which
gets populated at startup with data. The h2 console is automatically exposed at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
and it is possible to inspect the content of the database using the `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` url.

A similar setup is provided for MySql in case a persistent database configuration is needed. Note that whenever the database type is changed, the app needs to be run with a different profile: `spring.profiles.active=mysql` for MySql.

You could start MySql locally with whatever installer works for your OS, or with docker:

```
docker run -e MYSQL_USER=petclinic -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:5.7.8
```

Further documentation is provided [here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/blob/main/src/main/resources/db/mysql/petclinic_db_setup_mysql.txt).

## Working with Petclinic in your IDE

### Prerequisites

The following items should be installed in your system:

- Java 8 or newer (full JDK not a JRE).
- git command line tool (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
- Your preferred IDE
  - [Spring Tools Suite](https://spring.io/tools) (STS)
  - IntelliJ IDEA
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

### Steps:

1. On the command line
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
   ```
2. Inside Eclipse or STS

   ```
   File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven project
   ```

   Then either build on the command line `./mvnw generate-resources` or using the Eclipse launcher (right click on project and `Run As -> Maven install`) to generate the css. Run the application main method by right clicking on it and choosing `Run As -> Java Application`.

3. Inside IntelliJ IDEA
   In the main menu, choose `File -> Open` and select the Petclinic [pom.xml](pom.xml). Click on the `Open` button.

   CSS files are generated from the Maven build. You can either build them on the command line `./mvnw generate-resources` or right click on the `spring-petclinic` project then `Maven -> Generates sources and Update Folders`.

   A run configuration named `PetClinicApplication` should have been created for you if you're using a recent Ultimate version. Otherwise, run the application by right clicking on the `PetClinicApplication` main class and choosing `Run 'PetClinicApplication'`.

4. Navigate to Petclinic

   Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Interesting Spring Petclinic branches and forks

The Spring Petclinic "main" branch in the [spring-projects](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)
GitHub org is the "canonical" implementation, currently based on Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. There are
[quite a few forks](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/docs/forks.html) in a special GitHub org
[spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic). If you have a special interest in a different technology stack
that could be used to implement the Pet Clinic then please join the community there.
